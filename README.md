# Building a multi-class classification model for imbalance data to predict burn severity using Python
=======
This is the code repository for [Deep-forest-Py]. The details about the notebook and requirements of this projects is listed below.
## About the Note Book
The objective of the project is
* Finding out the importance feature before classification to reduce time and improve
classification accuracy
* Make a multiclass classification Model for imbalanced data to predict Burn Severity from
LiDAR Metrics and asses the accuracy of the model.
* predict a dummy data to test the model accuracy.
